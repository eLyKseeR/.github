## eLyKseeR - cryptographic data archive

This is the home of _eLyKseeR_ the cryptographic data archive.

Our repositories are organised in three groups:

*1)* at the base is our formal specification and validation in Coq/Rocq [elykseer-ml](https://github.com/eLyKseeR/elykseer-ml)

*2)* there are supporting repositories
  - for example, [elykseer-crypto](https://github.com/eLyKseeR/elykseer-crypto) is a collection of cryptographic primitives

*3)* and there is an implementation in C++ [elykseer-cpp](https://github.com/eLyKseeR/elykseer-cpp)

Our logo shows an elephant. It is a symbol for good memory and keeping a secret private.
So we aim at creating a software system that makes it simple to store data for years to come while also providing best cryptographic protection.
